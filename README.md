# StudentMezo-dApp
 DApp where students deposit Bitcoin (via Mezo), mint MUSD, and request microloans for education, tracked on a dashboard. Peer lenders fund loans by pooling MUSD to earn yield. Secure onboarding uses wallet connect and student verification. Smart contracts manage collateral, lending, repayments, and gamified rewards (NFTs, leaderboards).
